### HiðŸ‘‹, this is Jagdender.

~~They also call me ðŸ¦Š~~

<br/>

I am a software developer using various technologies, mainly **.NET**. I'm currently engaging in the area of **Web**, **Desktop** and **Software Architecture**.

The blog records my learning journey and my thoughts on various technologies.

I'll also post some of my daily life on it, just like what I do on my SNS.
